# Animal Classifier for WildGuard

This is an animal classifier for WildGuard.
The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals).
The model is based on an example from Kaggle by [Hamed Ghorbani](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hamedghorbani/90-different-animals-image-classification-92-5).

## Installation
All python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them by running:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`. I would recommend creating a virtual or conda environment before installing the packages.

## Usage
animal_classifier.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook that contains the code for training the model.
Please note that the data is not contained in this repository. You can download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in a `Data` folder.
In order to run Tensorflow on your GPU, you need to have CUDA installed on your machine. Good luck with that!
